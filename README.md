## A Full System Stack for NVM based Neuro-Processing-Unit Codesign from Device to Algorithm

Nonvolatile memory (NVM) based Neural-processing-unit (NPU) has been proposed to process general purpose machine intelligence algorithms with ultra-high energy efficiency. While the non-idealities of the analog devices and cross-point arrays make the practical application more complicated. In order to improve accuracy and robustness of the NVM based NPU, device-circuit-algorithm codesign with consideration of underlying device and array characteristics should outperform the optimization of individual device or algorithm.
- Here, we proposed an end-to-end full system stack with a joint device-circuit-architecture-algorithm analysis.
- Support traced simulation of on-chip inference and training
- The simulation results are calibrated with the fabricated RRAM based on-chip learning chip.
